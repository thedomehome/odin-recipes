    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li>6 eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tsp grated orange peel</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/3 cup self-rising flour</li>
        <li>4 tbsp powdered sugar, sifted</li>
        <li>3/4 cup Dulce de Leche</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350° F. Spray 15 x 10-inch jelly roll pan with nonstick cooking spray; line with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs in medium mixer bowl on medium speed until creamy and thick. Add granulated sugar one tablespoon at a time. Continue beating for about 5 to 7 minutes. Mixture should be thick and creamy. Add vanilla extract, grated orange peel and salt. Beat for 10 seconds.</li>
        <li>Sift flour into the egg mixture, carefully folding in with a spatula. Pour into prepared jelly roll pan; spread evenly with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until cake springs back when pressed. Remove from oven; let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lay out a clean kitchen towel that’s larger than the jelly roll pan; sprinkle with 2 tablespoons powdered sugar. Flip cake onto towel, gently peel off parchment paper and roll cake in towel starting from short side. Set aside; cool completely for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Unroll cake; cut off rough borders with a sharp serrated knife.</li>
        <li>Warm dulce de leche in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, for about 3 minutes or until a thick pourable consistency has been reached.</li>
        <li>Pour dulce de leche over cake, spread evenly with a spatula. Roll cake without towel and transfer to a small platter or large serving plate. Refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons powdered sugar. Slice with sharp serrated knife or unflavored dental floss and serve with berries.</li>
    </ol>
